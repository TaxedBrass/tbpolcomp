The Political Compass is notoriously inaccurate and stupid, so I tried to see if I could make a better version, and I think I did.

The Axes are Collectivist vs Individualist (vertically) and Globalist vs Identitarian (horizontally).

The idea is that it mostly aligns with where the normie thinks things go on the traditional political compass, while not being completely incoherent.

Here's a basic summary of the Axes for those not super certain of what they mean (keep in mind, people tend to have a lot of different definitions for these things, and these are just the ones that I'm using).

The Collectivist believes in the power of the group, community, or the state over the individual.

The Individualist believes in personal freedom, responsibility, and limited government. They prioritize individual rights over group needs.

The Globalist here believes in the spread of his ideology globally, to all people, races, religions, etc. They want to export their ideas, they are not at all exclusionary.

The Identitarian prioritizes national identity, tradition, sovereignty, and cultural preservation, generally leading to exclusionary policy.

This ends up resulting in a compass without contradiction as seen in the original. It also gets rid of the Authoritarian-Right and Libertarian-Left as ideas, as they're entirely logically incoherent (you can't have individual freedom and also redistributionism and a centrally planned economy, and you can't restrict people's freedoms while also having a free market).

Naturally, this ends up being, like all other compasses, just an organizational system, something to help our minds categorize things, but I think it does this much better than the original compass does. Let me know what you think.
